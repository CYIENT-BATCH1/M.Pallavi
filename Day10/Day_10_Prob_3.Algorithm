Write a program to Implement ”Selection Sort” using Recursion for given elements (Number elements will vary, so make it as configurable item)
How Selection sort works is explained below.
ALGORITHM:
         *Read the array elements
         *we compare the first element with all the elements in an array
         *If second element is less than the first then swap.
         *similary repeat the process,compare second element with all the elements in an array.
         *Finally the ascending array will print
