 Set the register T0CON value such a way that bit TMR0ON and PSA bit are set (1), without disturbing the other bits.
II). Find out the value of T0PS2, T0PS1, T0PS0 bits in T0CON register if the value of the register is 0xF3

ALGORITHM:
1)	     *Read the T0CON register values 
	       *In T0CON register we are setting the TMR0ON and PSA bit to 1 they are at the position 3 and 7 
	       *To set the bit we are using bitwise operators like [reg|=(1<<3)|(1<<7)]
2)       *Find the position 0,1,2 in T0CON register value they given as 0XF3
	       *To find the positi0n we are (reg>>pos)&1 we get the whether it is 0 or 1.
