Write a code to swap even bits with odd bits in unsigned long variable(uint64).
Example: bit 0 with bit 1; bit 2 with bit 3; bit 4 with bit

ALGORITHM:
	        *Read the two hexa variables of x and y
	        *To swap odd to even and even to odd we are doing right shift by 1 and left shift by 1
         	*finally resultant will get by adding both of them.
