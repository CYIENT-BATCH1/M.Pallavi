I). Set the register SSPSTAT value such a way that bit CKE, P and S bit are cleared (0),
without disturbing the other bits.
II). Find out the value of UA, BF, SMP bits in SSPSTAT register if the value of the register is 0x55

ALGORITHM:
1)	*In SSPSTAT register value as OX3f and that register CKE,P and S bits should be cleared
	  *To clear the bits register&~((1<<3)|(1<<4)|(1<<6)),here 3,4,5 are the positions to clear
    *In SSPSTAT register we are taking different value as 0x55 and find the value present in UA,BF,SMP are at the postion of 0,1,and 7 
    *To find these values we should right shift position and with 1 to get value present in particular position.
